### Summary:
IMPORTANT:  Use richerText = true input attribute if you want to leverage these enhanced features.  Otherwise leave empty and regular input Rich Text component will be used.

    a.	Control whether this is a block that prevents next/finish of flow.
2)	Search and Replace custom text
3)	Auto-Replace suggested words
